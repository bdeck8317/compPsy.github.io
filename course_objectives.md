## Course Objectives

A key tenet of this course is “learning how to learn”. Students will not learn everything they need to know about programming or data science in this course but will become more comfortable with programming environments and vernacular. As a result, they will be empowered to develop skills on their own going forward. This course is designed to be completed online asynchronously with the guidance of a teaching assistant (an upper-level Applied Cognitive and Brain Sciences student). 
The specific learning outcomes of this course are:

* Basic Literacy
  * Basic literacy in common programming applications
  * Can navigate programming environments, install software, libraries, and packages
  * Basic understanding of how computer hardware interacts to execute computational tasks
* Basic Programming Skills
  * Learn about data types, data structures, and basic syntax in three common object-oriented scripting languages (R, Python, MATLAB)
  * Build foundational programming skills for data science
* Data Analysis
  * Have a basic understanding of how to approach a data analysis task computationally
  * Be able to read input, transform data, and produce output
* Data Hygiene
  * Have an organized approach to basic data analysis, organized folders and paths on their computer
  * Employ version control to maintain data projects
* Data Cleaning
  * Develop an understanding of and learn basic techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing
