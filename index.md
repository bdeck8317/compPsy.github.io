# Welcome to Data Science in Psychology

Hello and welcome to Data Science in Psychology. The goal of this course is to help you as an incoming graduate student in psychology to become acclimated to computer programming. A key tenet of this course is “learning how to learn.” You will not learn everything you need to know about programming or data science in this course but you will become more comfortable with programming environments and vernacular. As a result, you will be empowered to develop skills on your own moving forward.
