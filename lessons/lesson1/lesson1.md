In this lesson you will learn about the motivation for this course. 


This course is a high-level introduction to data science for psychology graduate students. It is designed for students without previous programming experience to develop basic literacy and comfort with data science. The course will cover rudimentary programming skills in three languages that are commonly used in graduate-level academic research in psychology and neuroscience (R, Python, and MATLAB). It is intended to fill the gap between statistics and data science for students who want to learn basic programming skills for their research but don’t know where to start. By gaining a foundational understanding of key programming concepts and practicing with basic syntax and skills in multiple (similar) programming languages, students will feel prepared to take graduate-level data science and statistics courses in which basic programming skills are assumed.


A key tenet of this course is “learning how to learn”. Students will not learn everything they need to know about programming or data science in this course but will become more comfortable with programming environments and vernacular. As a result, they will be empowered to develop skills on their own going forward. This course is designed to be completed online asynchronously with the guidance of a teaching assistant (an upper-level Applied Cognitive and Brain Sciences student). 
The specific learning outcomes of this course are:

* Basic Literacy
  * Basic literacy in common programming applications
  * Can navigate programming environments, install software, libraries, and packages
  * Basic understanding of how computer hardware interacts to execute computational tasks
* Basic Programming Skills
  * Learn about data types, data structures, and basic syntax in three common object-oriented scripting languages (R, Python, MATLAB)
  * Build foundational programming skills for data science
* Data Analysis
  * Have a basic understanding of how to approach a data analysis task computationally
  * Be able to read input, transform data, and produce output
* Data Hygiene
  * Have an organized approach to basic data analysis, organized folders and paths on their computer
  * Employ version control to maintain data projects
* Data Cleaning
  * Develop an understanding of and learn basic techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing

In this lesson you will get accustomed with multiple languages and environments. Likely this will be the most overwhelming part of the course as you go from knowing little about programming to information overload. Don't fret, there are plenty of resources online and built within this course to keep you on track. 

### Your computer's command line
The first order of business is to establish an understanding of a computers command line and what it is used for. 
* [Start here with the command line tutorial](command_line.md)


While we won't use BASH and the command line to much throughout this course, having at least a superficial understanding of the command line will prove to be useful to you in your future programming endeavors. 

### Software installation and environment configuration
Installing the software for the remainder of the course should not be challenging. We provide guides to installing R/ R-Studio, Python/ Jupyter Lab, and Matlab

* Check out the installation guide [here](installing_software.md)


### Language introductions

* [R and R-Studio introduction](r_intro.md)

* [Python and Jupyter Lab introduction](python_intro.md)

* [Matlab introduction](matlab_intro.md)
