In this lesson you will learn about the motivation for this course. 


This course is a high-level introduction to data science for psychology graduate students. It is designed for students without previous programming experience to develop basic literacy and comfort with data science. The course will cover rudimentary programming skills in three languages that are commonly used in graduate-level academic research in psychology and neuroscience (R, Python, and MATLAB). It is intended to fill the gap between statistics and data science for students who want to learn basic programming skills for their research but donâ€™t know where to start. By gaining a foundational understanding of key programming concepts and practicing with basic syntax and skills in multiple (similar) programming languages, students will feel prepared to take graduate-level data science and statistics courses in which basic programming skills are assumed.






In this lesson we will also get accustomed with multiple languages and environments. Likely this will be the most overwhelming part of the course as you go from knowing little about programming to information overload. Don't fret, there are plenty of resources online and built within this course to keep you on track.

### Software installation and environment configuration
Installing the software for the remainder of the course should not be challenging. We provide guides to installing R/ R-Studio, Python/ Jupyter Lab, and Matlab

* Check out the installation guide [here](installing_software.md)
