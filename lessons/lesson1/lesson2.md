# Lesson 2: The Ground Floor

In this lesson you will get accustomed with multiple languages and environments. Likely this will be the most overwhelming part of the course as you go from knowing little about programming to information overload. Don't fret, there are plenty of resources online and built within this course to keep you on track. 

### Your computer's command line
The first order of business is to establish an understanding of a computers command line and what it is used for. 
* [Start here with the command line tutorial](command_line.md)


While we won't use BASH and the command line to much throughout this course, having at least a superficial understanding of the command line will prove to be useful to you in your future programming endeavors. 

### Software installation and environment configuration
Installing the software for the remainder of the course should not be challenging. We provide guides to installing R/ R-Studio, Python/ Jupyter Lab, and Matlab

* Check out the installation guide [here](installing_software.md)


### Language introductions

* [R and R-Studio introduction](r_intro.md)

* [Python and Jupyter Lab introduction](python_intro.md)

* [Matlab introduction](matlab_intro.md)
