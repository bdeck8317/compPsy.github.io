# Resources for course and extra tips and tricks



# Books

Below are a list of books that can help you on your journey to understanding programming and data science more broadly.

* [Data Science From Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)
* [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com)




## Python
For Python programming there are a number of great resources. 
* Youtube, specifically [Corey Schafer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured) ---Some are beyond the scope of this class. However, they will be helpful if you continue on your coding journey.

* This one may seem obvious, but [python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is very well written. You can access this also by wrapping some of your commands in a help function
 e.g.
 
```python
In [1]: help(print())

Help on NoneType object:

class NoneType(object)
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __bool__(self, /)
 |      self != 0
 |
 |  __repr__(self, /)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
       Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
```



* Finally if you're interested in statistical methods/ data science in python, this book is often widely used in courses [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)



## R
R is another language which has many resources. Many of the statistical functions were actually written by statisticians so their documentation is typically very detailed. 

* Basic programming documentation can be found using R's [CRAN project website](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html)

* Like python, R also has a similar help function which will allow you to see documentation for a function right in the RStudio GUI.

Try the following in your RStudio terminal.
```R
help(lm)

# or 

?lm
```


## General coding information

If you want to learn how to keep your code organized and clean [here](http://cleancoder.com/products) is a great source on clean coding and keeping your projects organized. 

## Computer Hardware articles and information
As you move into more advanced programming and want to start to understand what the computer is actually doing from a pragmattic standpoint, we recommend that you take a look at the following articles which. Each article outlines some of the major hardware that will be doing the heavy lifting when programming and running your analyses. It's important to have at least a high-level understanding how these components interact to produce results for your programs you write.

* First, it's good to know a little bit of the history, if nothing else because it's just simply interesting. Check out the article [here.](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/computer-history-sysadmins)

* Want to learn more about your computer's processor, look no [further](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cpu-components-functionality)

* What about RAM and Storage? Check [this](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/memory-and-storage) article out.

## Git and GitHub

* Main [Git](https://git-scm.com/) websight for quick documentation
