# Resources for course and extra tips and tricks

While this course is not meant to be an all encompassing tour de force of programming knowledge, we do recommend that you continue to program outside of this course. We hope that this course does at least two things. 


1. Relinquishes any fears you may have regarding getting started programming. It's going to be a little tricky, but that's okay. The payoff is that you are learning a skill that will undoubtly make your life easier when dealing with data and can help you to automate many things you would have spent hours doing previously.

2. Teaches you how to search for answers. You aren't always going to have the answers, that's totally fine and you should expect this. In many cases, it's not knowing the answer, but instead, it's knowing you can find it with ease. This tends to take a bit of time before you are actually good at it (that may sound weird).


## Python
For Python programming there are a number of great resources. 
* Youtube, specifically [Corey Schafer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured) ---Mostare beyond the scope of this class. However, as you get more advanced and more interested in programming they will be helpful.

* This one may seem obvious, but [python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). You can access this also by wrapping some of your commands in a help function
 e.g.
 
``` 
In [1]: help(print())

Help on NoneType object:

class NoneType(object)
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __bool__(self, /)
 |      self != 0
 |
 |  __repr__(self, /)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
 
 ```



* Finally if you're interested in statistical methods/ data science in python, this book is often widely used in courses [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)



## R
R is another language which has many resources. Many of the statistical functions were actually written by statisticians so their documentation is typically very detailed. 
* Basic programming documentation can be found using R's [CRAN project website](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html)

* Like python, R also has a similar help function which will allow you to see documentation for a function right in the RStudio GUI.

Try the following in your RStudio terminal.
```
help(lm)

# or 

?lm
```


* Data Science in R using the [Tidyverse environment](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/)

## General coding information

If you want to learn how to keep your code organized and clean [here](http://cleancoder.com/products) is a great source on clean coding and keeping your projects organized. 

## Computer Hardware articles and information
As you move into more advanced programming and want to start to understand what the computer is actually doing from a pragmattic standpoint, we recommend that you take a look at the following articles which. Each article outlines some of the major hardware that will be doing the heavy lifting when programming and running your analyses. It's important to have at least a high-level understanding how these components interact to produce results for your programs you write.

* First, it's good to know a little bit of the history, if nothing else because it's just simply interesting. Check out the article [here.](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/computer-history-sysadmins)

* Want to learn more about your computer's processor, look no [further](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cpu-components-functionality)

* What about RAM and Storage? Check [this](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/memory-and-storage) article out.

## Git and GitHub

* Main [Git](https://git-scm.com/) websight for quick documentation
* Free Book on [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
