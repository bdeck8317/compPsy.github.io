# Resources for course and extra tips and tricks

While this course is not meant to be an all encompassing tour de force of programming knowledge, we do recommend that you continue to program outside of this course. We hope that this course does at least two things. 


1. Relinquishes any fears you may have regarding getting started programming. It's going to be a little tricky, but that's okay. The payoff is that you are learning a skill that will undoubtly make your life easier when dealing with data and can help you to automate many things you would have spent hours doing previously.

2. Teaches you how to search for answers. You aren't always going to have the answers, that's totally fine and you should expect this. In many cases, it's not knowing the answer, but instead, it's knowing you can find it with ease. This tends to take a bit of time before you are actually good at it (that may sound weird).


For Python programming there are a number of great resources. 
* Youtube, specifically [Corey Schafer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms/featured) ---Mostare beyond the scope of this class. However, as you get more advanced and more interested in programming they will be helpful.

* This one may seem obvious, but [python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). You can access this also by wrapping some of your commands in a help function
 e.g.
``` 
In [1]: help(print())

Help on NoneType object:

class NoneType(object)
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __bool__(self, /)
 |      self != 0
 |
 |  __repr__(self, /)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
 ```



* Finally if you're interested in statistical methods/ data science in python, this book is often widely used in courses [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)
